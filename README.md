# jubilant-octo-palm-tree
The phrase "jubilant-octo-palm-tree" comes from a coastal village's legend of a magical palm tree with eight branches, believed to bring joy and good fortune. During the annual festival, the tree would sway and hum, filling everyone with bliss. A storyteller coined the phrase to describe this joy, and it became a symbol of exuberance.
